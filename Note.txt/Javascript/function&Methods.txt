In programming, especially in languages like JavaScript, **functions** and **methods** are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings based on context. Here's the difference:

### 1. **Function**
A **function** is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It can be defined independently and invoked anywhere in the code. Functions can take arguments and return values.

**Example of a Function:**
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

**Characteristics of Functions:**
- Defined using the `function` keyword or arrow function syntax (`()=>`).
- Can exist independently of objects.
- Called by its name.

### 2. **Method**
A **method** is a function that is associated with an object or class. It is a property of an object that holds a function definition.

**Example of a Method:**
```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Bob",
  greet: function() {
    return "Hello, " + this.name + "!";
  }
};
console.log(person.greet()); // Output: Hello, Bob!
```

**Characteristics of Methods:**
- A method is a function stored as a property of an object.
- Uses the `this` keyword to refer to the object it belongs to.
- Called using the object reference, e.g., `object.method()`.

### Key Differences
| Feature               | Function                            | Method                               |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Association**       | Independent, not tied to an object   | Associated with an object or class    |
| **Call Syntax**       | `functionName()`                     | `objectName.methodName()`             |
| **Use of `this`**     | Usually does not use `this`          | Uses `this` to refer to the object    |
| **Example**           | `greet()`                            | `person.greet()`                      |

In summary, **all methods are functions**, but not all functions are methods. The key difference is whether the function is associated with an object.
