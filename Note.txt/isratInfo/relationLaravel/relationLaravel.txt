In Laravel 11, database relations are handled through **Eloquent ORM**, which makes it easy to define and interact with the relationships between database tables. Relationships in Eloquent are expressed as methods within your models, and they define how tables in your database relate to each other.

Laravel supports several types of relationships:

### 1. **One-to-One Relationship**

A **one-to-one relationship** is used when a record in one table is related to exactly one record in another table. For example, a `User` might have one `Profile`.

#### Example:

```php
// User.php
class User extends Model
{
    public function profile()
    {
        return $this->hasOne(Profile::class);
    }
}

// Profile.php
class Profile extends Model
{
    public function user()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }
}
```

- The `User` model uses the `hasOne` method to indicate that it has a related `Profile`.
- The `Profile` model uses `belongsTo` to define the inverse of the relationship.

### 2. **One-to-Many Relationship**

A **one-to-many relationship** is used when a record in one table can have multiple related records in another table. For example, a `Post` might have many `Comment`s.

#### Example:

```php
// Post.php
class Post extends Model
{
    public function comments()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
    }
}

// Comment.php
class Comment extends Model
{
    public function post()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Post::class);
    }
}
```

- The `Post` model uses the `hasMany` method to indicate that it can have multiple `Comment`s.
- The `Comment` model uses `belongsTo` to define the inverse relationship.

### 3. **Many-to-Many Relationship**

A **many-to-many relationship** is used when records in both tables can have multiple related records. For example, a `User` can belong to many `Role`s, and a `Role` can be assigned to many `User`s.

#### Example:

```php
// User.php
class User extends Model
{
    public function roles()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Role::class);
    }
}

// Role.php
class Role extends Model
{
    public function users()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(User::class);
    }
}
```

- This requires a **pivot table** (e.g., `role_user`), which contains the `user_id` and `role_id` columns.
- You can create the pivot table using a migration:
  
  ```bash
  php artisan make:migration create_role_user_table --create=role_user
  ```

### 4. **Has-One-Through Relationship**

A **has-one-through relationship** allows you to define a one-to-one relationship that exists through an intermediary model. For example, a `Supplier` has one `Country` through an `Account`.

#### Example:

```php
// Supplier.php
class Supplier extends Model
{
    public function country()
    {
        return $this->hasOneThrough(Country::class, Account::class);
    }
}
```

### 5. **Has-Many-Through Relationship**

A **has-many-through relationship** is used to define a one-to-many relationship through an intermediary model. For example, a `Country` has many `Posts` through `User`s.

#### Example:

```php
// Country.php
class Country extends Model
{
    public function posts()
    {
        return $this->hasManyThrough(Post::class, User::class);
    }
}
```

### 6. **Polymorphic Relationships**

A **polymorphic relationship** allows a model to belong to multiple other models. For example, a `Photo` might belong to both a `Post` and a `User`.

#### One-to-One Polymorphic Relationship:

```php
// Photo.php
class Photo extends Model
{
    public function imageable()
    {
        return $this->morphTo();
    }
}

// User.php and Post.php
class User extends Model
{
    public function photos()
    {
        return $this->morphMany(Photo::class, 'imageable');
    }
}

class Post extends Model
{
    public function photos()
    {
        return $this->morphMany(Photo::class, 'imageable');
    }
}
```

- Here, a `Photo` can be associated with either a `User` or a `Post` using the same `imageable_id` and `imageable_type` fields.

### 7. **Polymorphic Many-to-Many Relationship**

A **polymorphic many-to-many relationship** allows you to define a many-to-many relationship where a model can belong to more than one type of model. For example, a `Tag` might be applied to both `Post` and `Video` models.

#### Example:

```php
// Tag.php
class Tag extends Model
{
    public function posts()
    {
        return $this->morphedByMany(Post::class, 'taggable');
    }

    public function videos()
    {
        return $this->morphedByMany(Video::class, 'taggable');
    }
}

// Post.php and Video.php
class Post extends Model
{
    public function tags()
    {
        return $this->morphToMany(Tag::class, 'taggable');
    }
}

class Video extends Model
{
    public function tags()
    {
        return $this->morphToMany(Tag::class, 'taggable');
    }
}
```

### 8. **Eager Loading Relationships**

Eager loading improves query performance by loading related models upfront rather than lazy loading them later. This prevents the **N+1 query problem**.

Example of eager loading:
```php
$posts = Post::with('comments')->get();  // Load posts with their comments
```

### 9. **Querying Relationships**

You can query relations using various methods:
- **Querying existence of relationship**:
  ```php
  $users = User::has('posts')->get();
  ```

- **Querying with constraints**:
  ```php
  $posts = Post::whereHas('comments', function($query) {
      $query->where('is_approved', 1);
  })->get();
  ```

### 10. **Saving Related Models**

You can easily save related models using Eloquent's `save` or `saveMany` methods:
```php
$post = Post::find(1);
$comment = new Comment(['body' => 'A new comment']);
$post->comments()->save($comment);  // Save a comment to the post
```

### Conclusion

Laravel 11 continues to provide robust support for working with relational databases through Eloquent ORM. The relationships in Laravel are simple to define, making it easier to work with relational data without writing complex SQL queries manually.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eloquent ORM:

Eloquent ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is Laravel's default and powerful ORM that simplifies the interaction between an application and its database. ORM allows you to work with database tables as if they were PHP objects, abstracting the underlying SQL queries into a more intuitive and expressive syntax.

In Eloquent, each database table corresponds to a **model**, and you can perform typical database operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data using PHP methods instead of raw SQL. This provides a more developer-friendly way to interact with databases.

### Key Features of Eloquent ORM

1. **Models as Classes**:
   Each database table has a corresponding **model class**, and rows of the table are represented as instances (objects) of that class. For example, if you have a `users` table, you might have a `User` model in your Laravel application.

   ```php
   class User extends Model
   {
       // The table associated with the model (if not using the default 'users' table)
       protected $table = 'users';
   }
   ```

2. **CRUD Operations**:
   Eloquent makes it easy to perform **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** operations.

   - **Create**:
     ```php
     $user = new User;
     $user->name = 'John Doe';
     $user->email = 'john@example.com';
     $user->save();  // Insert into the database
     ```

   - **Read**:
     ```php
     $user = User::find(1); // Find user by ID
     $users = User::all();  // Get all users
     ```

   - **Update**:
     ```php
     $user = User::find(1);
     $user->name = 'Jane Doe';
     $user->save();  // Update the user's data
     ```

   - **Delete**:
     ```php
     $user = User::find(1);
     $user->delete();  // Delete the user
     ```

3. **Relationships**:
   Eloquent allows you to define relationships between different models (tables) in a very clean and expressive way:
   - One-to-One
   - One-to-Many
   - Many-to-Many
   - Polymorphic relationships

   Example of a one-to-many relationship:
   ```php
   class Post extends Model
   {
       public function comments()
       {
           return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
       }
   }

   class Comment extends Model
   {
       public function post()
       {
           return $this->belongsTo(Post::class);
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Query Builder**:
   Eloquent provides an elegant way to build queries. You can filter, sort, paginate, and perform more complex queries easily:
   ```php
   $activeUsers = User::where('active', 1)->orderBy('name')->get();
   ```

5. **Timestamps**:
   Eloquent automatically manages `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps for models. If your table has these columns, Eloquent will update them automatically when records are created or modified.

6. **Eager Loading**:
   Eloquent allows **eager loading**, which retrieves related models in the same query to prevent **N+1 query problem**:
   ```php
   $posts = Post::with('comments')->get();  // Load posts with their comments
   ```

7. **Mutators & Accessors**:
   Eloquent provides mutators and accessors, which allow you to modify data before it is saved or retrieved.

   - **Accessor** (modifies data when retrieved):
     ```php
     public function getFullNameAttribute()
     {
         return $this->first_name . ' ' . $this->last_name;
     }
     ```

   - **Mutator** (modifies data before saving):
     ```php
     public function setPasswordAttribute($value)
     {
         $this->attributes['password'] = bcrypt($value);
     }
     ```

8. **Soft Deleting**:
   Eloquent supports **soft deleting**, which allows you to mark a record as deleted without actually removing it from the database:
   ```php
   use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;

   class User extends Model
   {
       use SoftDeletes;
   }
   ```

### Why Use Eloquent ORM?
- **Simplifies database operations**: You don't need to write raw SQL queries. Eloquent allows you to interact with the database using PHP methods.
- **Readable syntax**: Code is more expressive and easier to understand.
- **Relationships**: Eloquent makes working with relationships between tables intuitive and straightforward.
- **Consistency and Security**: Eloquent handles common database operations securely, helping prevent SQL injection and other vulnerabilities.

In short, Eloquent ORM abstracts complex database operations and lets you work with database records as objects, simplifying your code and making it more maintainable.
