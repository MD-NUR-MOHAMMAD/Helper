In PHP, the `->` operator is used to access **properties** and **methods** of an object. It signifies that you are working with an instance of a class and want to reference something within that object.

### How it Works:

1. **Accessing Properties:**
   The `->` operator is used to access the **property** of an object.
   ```php
   class Car {
       public $color;

       public function __construct($color) {
           $this->color = $color;
       }
   }

   $myCar = new Car("red");
   echo $myCar->color; // Outputs: red
   ```

2. **Calling Methods:**
   The `->` operator is also used to call **methods** of an object.
   ```php
   class Car {
       public $color;

       public function __construct($color) {
           $this->color = $color;
       }

       public function describe() {
           return "This car is " . $this->color;
       }
   }

   $myCar = new Car("blue");
   echo $myCar->describe(); // Outputs: This car is blue
   ```

### Key Notes:
- The `->` operator only works with objects (instances of a class). If you try to use it with a non-object, PHP will throw an error.
- When accessing a property or method using `->`, ensure that the property or method has the appropriate visibility (`public`, `protected`, or `private`) to be accessed in the given context.
