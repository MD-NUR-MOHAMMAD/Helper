It seems like you may be asking about **Spatie Laravel Permission**, a popular package for handling roles and permissions in Laravel applications. Here's a quick rundown:

### Spatie Laravel Permission

**Spatie Laravel Permission** is a package developed by Spatie that makes it easy to manage **roles and permissions** in a Laravel application. With this package, you can assign roles to users, assign permissions to roles, and directly assign permissions to users.

### Features of Spatie Laravel Permission
1. **Role-based Access Control**:
   - You can define roles such as `Admin`, `Editor`, or `User`, and assign these roles to users.
2. **Permission-based Access Control**:
   - Define permissions like `create posts`, `edit posts`, `delete posts`, and assign these permissions to roles or users.
3. **Direct Permission Assignment**:
   - Permissions can be assigned directly to a user without needing to go through a role.
4. **Team or Multi-tenancy Support**:
   - The package supports using permissions in a team or multi-tenancy context.
5. **Middleware for Authorization**:
   - Middleware is provided to protect routes based on roles or permissions.

### Key Concepts
1. **Roles**:
   Roles are groups of permissions. For example:
   - `Admin` may have permissions to manage users and posts.
   - `Editor` may have permissions to edit and publish posts.

2. **Permissions**:
   Permissions represent specific abilities, such as `edit articles` or `delete users`.

   ```

   ```php
   use Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles;

   class User extends Authenticatable
   {
       use HasRoles;
   }
   ```

4. **Define Roles and Permissions**:
   Use artisan commands or code to create roles and permissions:
   ```php
   use Spatie\Permission\Models\Role;
   use Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission;

   Role::create(['name' => 'admin']);
   Permission::create(['name' => 'edit articles']);

   $role = Role::findByName('admin');
   $role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

   $user = User::find(1);
   $user->assignRole('admin');
   ```

### Using in Middleware

You can use middleware to restrict access to routes based on roles or permissions:
```php
Route::group(['middleware' => ['role:admin']], function () {
    Route::get('/admin', 'AdminController@index');
});
```
