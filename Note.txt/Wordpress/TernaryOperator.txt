In the example you provided, the **ternary operator** is used to assign a value to `status` based on the value of `age`. Let’s break it down step-by-step:

### Code
```javascript
let age = 16;
let status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
console.log(status);  // Output: "Minor"
```

### Explanation
1. **Condition**: `(age >= 18)` — Checks if `age` is greater than or equal to 18.
2. **True value**: `"Adult"` — This will be assigned if the condition is true.
3. **False value**: `"Minor"` — This will be assigned if the condition is false.
4. Since `age` is 16, the condition `(age >= 18)` evaluates to `false`, so `"Minor"` is assigned to `status`.
5. `console.log(status)` prints `"Minor"` to the console.

### Output
```
Minor
``` 

This is a classic use of the **ternary operator** for conditional assignments.
